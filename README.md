### üìã Step-by-Step Installation Guide

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/your-team/thryve.git
cd thryve
```

#### **2. Set Up Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
env\\Scripts\\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate
```

#### **3. Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install django psycopg2 dj-database-url python-dotenv
```

#### **4. Set Up Supabase Database**

1. **Create Supabase Project:**
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose your organization and set project details
   - Wait for project setup to complete

2. **Get Database Connection Details:**
   - In your Supabase project dashboard
   - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Database**
   - Copy the **Connection Pooling** connection string (Session Pooler)
   - It should look like: `postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@aws-0-<project-ref>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`

#### **5. Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
touch .env  # On Windows: echo. > .env
```

Add the following to your `.env` file:
```env
# Django Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-django-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Supabase Database Configuration (Session Pooler)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@aws-0-<project-ref>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your Supabase database password
- Replace `<project-ref>` with your actual project reference from Supabase
- Keep `sslmode=require` as Supabase enforces SSL connections

#### **6. Database Setup**
```bash
# Create and apply database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### **7. Verify Database Connection (Optional)**
```bash
# Test if Django can connect to Supabase
python manage.py shell

# In the Django shell, run:
import os
print(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
# Should display your connection string

# Test database connectivity
from django.db import connection
cursor = connection.cursor()
print("Database connection successful!")
exit()
```

#### **8. Run the Development Server**
```bash
# Start Django development server
python manage.py runserver

# Access the application at:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### **Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# If migrations fail, check your DATABASE_URL
python manage.py shell
import os
print(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))

# Ensure .env file is in the correct location (project root)
# Verify Supabase project is active and credentials are correct
```
